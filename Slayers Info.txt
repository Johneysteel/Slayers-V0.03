Slayer V0.03 - Equipment Update
- A dict representing slots on the combatant class
- Created an Equipment class to generate equipment objects

# Equipment object
The equipment object requires a Name and Slot.
The stats of the object is a dict that can be entered but defaults to strength, defence, speed.

The stats can be generated using the generateStatsByLevel or generateStatsByRate method
The generateStatsByLevel method will let you input a level and will calculate points appropriate to that level. The points will then be randomly distrubuted based the number of stats you have.

The generateStatsByRate method will let you specify the amount of points and the rate (percentage) of negative points.

Given 90 points and a 20% negative rate, you end up with.
72 positive points
18 negative points
These points are distrubuted throughout the number of skills you have.

This will mean all items will always have the same total number of points when added.
Iron Helmet stats: [38.0, 10.0, 6.0]    = 54 points
Iron Helmet stats: [30.0, 17.0, 7.0]    = 54 points
Iron Helmet stats: [30.0, 1.0, 23.0]    = 54 points
Iron Helmet stats: [11.0, 18.0, 25.0]   = 54 points

To add more variety I could make the positive and negative be random.
0-72 positive
0-18 negative

This way the stats would be more varied for items of the same level.

You could end up with an item that has 
maximum positive with minumum negative, 
minimum positive with maximum negative,
or anything in between.

This would add a lot of variety when weighing options for upgrading, buying/selling items.

# Generating Equipment
It might be interesting to have different slot equipment have different skills instead of a default strength, speed and defence.

For example:
An mainhand weapons like swords, axes, hammers could have strength and speed stats
A body armour could have defence, speed and health stats
A offhand shield could have defence, and speed stats
A neck slot object could have defence, speed, strength, mainhand

The point is to give appropriate attributes to appropriate slot items.
Why would a shield increase your strength?
why would iron armour increase your attack?
It makes sense to omit certain stats from certain items.

for a playable demo to ensure the combat flows properly, ill ensure the methods exist to fully incorporate equipment into combat. Later on I will come back and make better sense of the stats per item.
